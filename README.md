# The schedule planner

Take an arbitrary list of weighted "lessons" and calculate the most ideal and valid layout for them based on weighing rules.

Base algorithm seems to work, will add UI soon.

## Install

- clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/JustusAdam/schedule-planner`

## Usage

None yet :D

You may test it right now just executing the program `dist/`
